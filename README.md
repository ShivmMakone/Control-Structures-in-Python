Control Structures in Python

## Python Basic Tasks Repository  
This repository contains two Python programs demonstrating control structures such as **if-else statements** and **loops**.

---

## Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
### Description:
- This program takes **an integer input** from the user.
- It checks whether the number is **even or odd** using an `if-else` statement.
- The result is displayed accordingly.

### Code Explanation:
- The user inputs a number.
- The program checks if the number is divisible by `2` using the modulus operator `%`.
- If `num % 2 == 0`, it prints that the number is **even**; otherwise, it prints that it is **odd**.

### How to Run:
1. Run `even_odd.py` in any Python environment.
2. Enter an integer when prompted.
3. View whether the number is **even** or **odd**.

### Example Output:
Enter a number: 7
7 is an odd number.

Enter a number: 10
10 is an even number.




## Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop
### Description:
- This program calculates the **sum of integers from 1 to 50** using a loop.
- It uses a **for loop** to iterate through numbers and adds them.
- The final sum is displayed.

### Code Explanation:
- A `for` loop iterates from `1` to `50`.
- Each number is added to `total_sum`.
- After the loop completes, the total sum is printed.

### How to Run:
1. Run `sum_integers.py` in any Python environment.
2. The program will automatically calculate and display the sum.

### Example Output:
The sum of integers from 1 to 50 is: 1275
